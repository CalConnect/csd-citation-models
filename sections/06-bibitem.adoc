== Bibliographic Item Model

The following is a UML model intended to capture the structures represented in
<<iso690>>, and is intended as a reference model for <<iso690>>. The various
elements of the model are discussed below, with illustrations using the sample
serialisation (<<serialisation>>).

The reference model for citations is provided in <<citationmodel>>.
