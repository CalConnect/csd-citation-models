== Bibliographic Item Model

The following is a UML model intended to capture the structures represented in
<<iso690>>, and is intended as a reference model for <<iso690>>. The various
elements of the model are discussed below, with illustrations using the sample
serialisation (<<serialisation>>).

The reference model for citations is provided in <<citationmodel>>.

.BibliographicItem model
====
image::iso690xml/images/png/Bibliography__BibliographicItem_0.png[]
====

BibliographicItem/title:: The title of the bibliographic item.

BibliographicItem/title/type:: The type for the given title of the bibliographic item.

BibliographicItem/link:: A URI associated with the bibliographic item.

BibliographicItem/type:: The type of the bibliographic item.

BibliographicItem/docIdentifier:: An identifier of the bibliographic item in an international standard scheme.

BibliographicItem/docIdentifier/type:: The scheme of the identifier

BibliographicItem/docIdentifier/id:: The identifier itself within the international standard scheme.

BibliographicItem/date:: A date-time associated with the production of or access to the bibliographic item.

BibliographicItem/contributor:: A contributor the production of the bibliographic item.

BibliographicItem/edition:: The edition or version of the bibliographic item.

BibliographicItem/note:: A note associated with the bibliographic item.

BibliographicItem/language:: The language(s) in which the bibliographic item is expressed.

BibliographicItem/script:: The script(s) in which the bibliographic item is written.

BibliographicItem/formattedRef:: A pre-formatted version of the bibliographic item reference,
used to sidestep the rendering of the reference out of its component parts.

BibliographicItem/abstract:: The abstract of the bibliographic item.

TODO: include?

BibliographicItem/status/status:: The publication or preparation status of the bibliographic item.

TODO: include? Much more relevant for standards, forms part of the customisation of this model for standards.

BibliographicItem/copyright:: The copyright status of the bibliographic item.

BibliographicItem/copyright/from:: The copyright date of the bibliographic item.

BibliographicItem/copyright/to:: The date when the copyright of the bibliographic item expires.

BibliographicItem/copyright/owner:: The copyright owner for the bibliographic item.

BibliographicItem/relation:: The relation of the bibliographic item to another bibliographic item.

BibliographicItem/series:: The series of the bibliographic item.

BibliographicItem/medium:: Information about the physical medium of the bibliographic item.

BibliographicItem/medium/form:: The form of the physical medium of the bibliographic item.

BibliographicItem/medium/size:: The size of the physical medium of the bibliographic item.

BibliographicItem/medium/scale:: The scale of the cartographic material in the bibliographic item.

BibliographicItem/place:: The geographic location associated with the production of the bibliographic item.

BibliographicItem/extent:: The extent of the bibliographic item.

BibliographicItem/accessLocation:: The location where the bibliographic item may be accessed.

BibliographicItem/classification:: The classification of the bibliographic item according to a standard classification scheme.

BibliographicItem/validity:: Information about how long the current description of the bibliographic item is valid for.



=== Validity

The representation of a bibliographic item can optionally include information
on the time interval where this bibliographic item
is determined valid, and the revision number (represented as a date).
Each of such is represented as a `Iso8601DateTime` object.

ValidityInfo/validityBegins:: the date and time when this object becomes valid.
The value type is `Iso8601DateTime`.

ValidityInfo/validityEnds:: the date and time when this object becomes invalid.
The value type is `Iso8601DateTime`.

ValidityInfo/revision:: issuance date/time of this object.
The value type is `Iso8601DateTime`.


Serialization of `ValidityInfo` is demonstrated below.

=== Series

.BibliographicSeries model
====

SeriesType/type:: The type of series description expressed in this container.
The main type (which is the default) is the current, authoritative series

SeriesType/title:: The title of the series.

SeriesType/place:: The place where the series is issued; used for disambiguation.

SeriesType/organization:: The organization issuing the series; used for disambiguation.

Series/formattedTitle:: A pre-formatted version of the series description, incorporating

Series/abbrev:: The abbreviation under which the series is known.

Series/dateFrom:: The start of the date range when the series has been known under the given title.

Series/dateTo:: The end of the date range when the series has been known under the given title.

Series/number:: The number of the bibliographic item within the series.

Series/partnumber:: The part-number of the bibliographic item within the series.



=== Bibliographic Dates

TODO: add date types from ISO 19115-1 `CI_Date` `expiry, lastupdate, lastrevision, nextupdate, unavailable, inForce, adopted, deprecated, distribution`

BibliographicDate:: Date associated with the production of or access to a bibliographic item.

BibliographicDate/type:: The phase of the production of or access to a bibliographic item.

BibliographicDate/from:: The start of the date range described.

BibliographicDate/to:: The end of the date range described.

BibliographicDate/on:: The point date described (mutually exclusive with date range).


=== Bibliographic Item Types


.BibliographicItemTypes

BibItemType:: The range of possible bibliographic items covered by this model. Note that
legal documents are expressly outside the scope of <<iso690>>.

TODO: we should not exclude legal documents.
