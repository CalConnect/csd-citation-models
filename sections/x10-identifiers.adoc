* Source: <<iso690,clause 12>>
* Serialisation: `bibitem/docidentifier`


<<iso690,clause 12>> argues that unique international standard identifiers
must be included in the bibliography. In practice, identifiers are included
at the discretion of the bibliographer: they are routinely included in
bibliographic databases, but seldom in references within documents.

Standards body identifiers for standards (<<iso690,clause 15.10>>) are modelled as series numbers rather than as identifiers (<<series>>).
