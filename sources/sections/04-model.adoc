== Reference model

This document provides a number of data models that collectively
provide the necessary data elements for the ISO 690 citation style.

In this document, the model is discussed with reference to <<iso690>>, with the
rendered
bibliographic references of each clause in <<iso690>> serialised according to
<<serialisation>>.

Each aspect of the model is given with a cross-reference to <<iso690>>; a
listing of the
relevant model components; and a listing of the corresponding components of
<<bibtex>>.
