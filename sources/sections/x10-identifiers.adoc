* Serialisation: `bibitem/docidentifier`


<<iso690,clause 12>> argues that unique international standard identifiers
must be included in the bibliography. In practice, identifiers are included
at the discretion of the bibliographer: they are routinely included in
bibliographic databases, but seldom in references within documents.

The scope of an identifier is introduced where an identifier identifies
only a component of the item (e.g. a document included in the item),
or a superset of the item (e.g. a series). It can also be used if the
identifier identifies a specific instantiation of the document as an entity;
in terms of the Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records <<frbr>>, for example,
an identifier may identify a work, an expression of the work (e.g. an edition),
a manifestation of the work (e.g. a format), or an item of the manifestation
(e.g. a single physical copy).

Neither the type nor the scope of the identifier have an associated controlled
vocabulary, and one is unlikely to be derived. Identifier type should
follow established practice in the domain; most well-known identifiers
have a widely used short name or abbreviation. 

Standards body identifiers for standards (<<iso690,clause 15.10>>)
may be modelled as series numbers or as identifiers (<<series>>).
We recommend that the canonical identifier issued for a standard by a
standards body be encoded as an identifier; other identifiers assigned
to the same document may be better identified with a series title, as a 
named and numbered grouping of documents.
